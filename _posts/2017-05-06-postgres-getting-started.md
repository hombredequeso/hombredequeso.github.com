[Postgres proto](https://github.com/hombredequeso/postgres-proto) documents the basic steps for getting Postgres up-and-running on a windows machine. It is  intended as a very simple dev machine setup for experimentation with postgres.

It includes the following:

* [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) running in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
* Test C# unit test to connect to a database, insert and retrieve a row using [Npgsql](http://www.npgsql.org/) and [Dapper](https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper).
